        <h4>
            A WiFi password can`t be less than 8 characters, and in 2000 that seemed to be
            enough. &quot;Today&quot; you can
            find a password for almost any WiFi network for literally $100.
            Enter your WiFi password to calculate how much money and time it would take for any child to access
            your
            WiFi network.

                    <p>
                        WiFi radio airwaves are available to any user, however, to secure networks, the WPA (Wi-Fi
                        Protected Access) standard was developed, at&nbsp;the current relevant standard is WPA3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WPA allows you to set a password on&nbsp;a WiFi network, to put it crudely, this password is a
                        cipher for all WiFi traffic within the channel for this network. This means that hackers can
                        still intercept network traffic, but without the password they cannot decrypt it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When initialising a connection with&nbsp;the correct password, WPA provides for the exchange of
                        private keys with&nbsp;the user, this is called a handshake. By intercepting the handshake, a
                        hacker can &laquo;pick&nbsp;the password from&nbsp;its cast. To put it simply and&nbsp;crudely,
                        there is no password in&nbsp;a handshake, there is its shadow. It is impossible to determine a
                        password from&nbsp;the shadow, however, it is quite easy to get the shadow from&nbsp;any
                        password. A hacker gets the shadow from&nbsp;the password 12345678 and&nbsp;compares it&nbsp;with&nbsp;the
                        shadow he&nbsp;got from&nbsp;the handshake. If your&nbsp;WiFi password is 12345678, then&nbsp;the
                        shadows will match.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, hackers can &laquo;pick&raquo; passwords by simple brute force, i.e. get shadows from&nbsp;00000000,
                        00000001, 00000002, etc. This kind of attack is called bruteforce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As is not&nbsp;difficult to guess, the longer the password, the harder it is to&laquo;pick&raquo;.
                        That is why in&nbsp;2000&nbsp;year, when the WPA format was developed, its founders set a
                        restriction&nbsp;&mdash; the password must be at least 8 characters long. At the time, it seemed
                        to be a permanent defence against&nbsp;picking. But&nbsp;&laquo;then&raquo;, these are the times
                        where Intel's flagship was a single-core Pentium III 866Mhz. Modern GPUs like Nvidia 4090 are
                        thousands of times more powerful, and&nbsp;picking a password of even&nbsp;8 characters is not&nbsp;such
                        a difficult task anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By intercepting a handshake, and&nbsp;for this hacker just needs to be close to&nbsp;your
                        network (for example, it can be a neighbour's child), most often the hacker is able to &laquo;pick&raquo;
                        your password, spending only $100.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Why it`s important?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Someone will say: &laquo;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;not&nbsp;greedy. If a neighbour's child is so advanced
                        that he can launch such an attack&nbsp;&mdash; I&nbsp;ll&nbsp;be happy for&nbsp;him&raquo;. And&nbsp;what
                        if I&nbsp;tell you that having a password from&nbsp;your network, a neighbour's child can not&nbsp;only
                        communicate with&nbsp;terrorists from&nbsp;your network, for example, but&nbsp;also&nbsp;intercept
                        all your traffic? In&nbsp;the https era, of course, this is not&nbsp;very relevant, but&nbsp;only
                        on&nbsp;the&nbsp;side. For example, it&nbsp;won&nbsp;t&nbsp;be able to read your correspondence
                        in&nbsp;mail or Facebook, however, it&nbsp;will&nbsp;be able to detect your porn sites,
                        calculate with&nbsp;accuracy up to&nbsp;a byte how much traffic and&nbsp;time you&nbsp;spend on&nbsp;YouTube,
                        will be able to see your VPN connections and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, you&nbsp;can set yourself a 12-character password (which is not&nbsp;quite right, more
                        details in&nbsp;the next article) with&nbsp;a lot of special characters, which&nbsp;would take
                        many thousands of years to&nbsp;find at current capacities. But&nbsp;you&nbsp;are&nbsp;completely
                        calmly entering passwords from&nbsp;&laquo;public&raquo; networks. Say, for example, a hotel has
                        a simple password 12345678, you&nbsp;enter it without a second thought and&nbsp;forget about&nbsp;the
                        fact that any of the&nbsp;guests of this hotel, knowing the password, can intercept and&nbsp;decrypt
                        your traffic. Again&nbsp;if you&nbsp;use https, a hacker will not&nbsp;be able to read your
                        correspondence or find out what pornographic film you&nbsp;watched last night before going to
                        bed, but&nbsp;he&nbsp;will&nbsp;know exactly what resources you&nbsp;ve visited and&nbsp;how
                        much time/traffic you&nbsp;ve spent on&nbsp;them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You&nbsp;re&nbsp;unlikely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;thrilled&nbsp;that any&nbsp;essentially passerby will
                        be able to know exactly what resources you&nbsp;re visiting + will be able to use your internet.
                        If it's the neighbour's kid and&nbsp;he&nbsp;s just doing it for fun, that's nice. But&nbsp;what
                        if your network is being used for illegal operations? What if there's a knock on YOUR door
                        tomorrow asking why you&nbsp;ve been downloading child pornography?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Someone will say: &laquo;Yes&nbsp;Who needs me? Yes&nbsp;who will bother? &raquo;. Firstly, you
                        need ) otherwise&nbsp;Facebook, Google and&nbsp;Apple would not&nbsp;collect&nbsp;all
                        information about&nbsp;you by&nbsp;bits and pieces. Secondly, in&nbsp;2022, the most populous
                        altcoin, Etherium, switched from&nbsp;proof-of-works to&nbsp;proof-of-stake. If you&nbsp;didn&nbsp;t&nbsp;understand
                        a&nbsp;word in&nbsp;the&nbsp;last sentence, just imagine that &laquo;miners&raquo; used to earn
                        money from&nbsp;video cards, and&nbsp;now they&nbsp;ve been completely deprived of that income.
                        On&nbsp;the main page I&nbsp;m&nbsp;providing calculations for&nbsp;one nvidia 4090 graphics
                        card, but&nbsp;now imagine that millions of the most powerful graphics cards around&nbsp;the
                        world a year ago lost&laquo;earnings&raquo; and&nbsp;are hanging around doing nothing.

                        Sorry if we&nbsp;ve scared you. In fact, it is not&nbsp;all so sad, and&nbsp;it is possible to
                        be quite safe inside your WiFi network and&nbsp;&laquo;invisible&raquo; in&nbsp;the public one.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rule 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Forget about&nbsp;WiFi passwords, you don&nbsp;t need them anymore. All you need to do is to
                        generate 1&nbsp;times a password with a length of 63&nbsp;characters (this is the maximum value
                        for a password in&nbsp;WPA), including ASCII special characters that are not present on the&nbsp;keyboard,
                        and&nbsp;generate a QR code for your network. All modern smartphones can read&nbsp;QR codes, you
                        will only need to take a picture of&nbsp;QR code or print it to &laquo;share&nbsp;it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In own WiFi network you can switch router to WPA2/WPA3 security mode (if your router can this).
                        It won't guarantee safety, but it can secure modern devices.

                        Use WiFi networks outside your home (outside your network)&nbsp;&mdash; only via VPN. Many
                        modern routers are able to create a VPN server, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;s not&nbsp;difficult to do if&nbsp;you
                        have a stationary computer at home, which is always switched on and&nbsp;always in&nbsp;the
                        network. It&nbsp;can be a single-board computer like RaspberryPI, which&nbsp;costs inexpensive
                        and&nbsp;takes up no&nbsp;space. You should make it a&nbsp;rule to use the Internet via WiFi
                        only via VPN from&nbsp;your home. Any passerby and&nbsp;hotel guest will still be able to
                        intercept your traffic, knowing the hotel password, but for them it will be encrypted VPN
                        traffic, which will definitely be useless without access to&nbsp;your VPN.

                        The aim of the project is to make the Internet safer. In&nbsp;the modern world, WiFi is the main
                        provider of the Internet, and&nbsp;we, the development team, understand both&nbsp;the problem
                        and&nbsp;ways to&nbsp;solve it.
