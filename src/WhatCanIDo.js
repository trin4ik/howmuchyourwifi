        <h1>What can i do?</h1>
        <p>
            Sorry if we&nbsp;ve scared you. In fact, it is not&nbsp;all so sad, and&nbsp;it is possible to be quite safe inside your WiFi network and&nbsp;&laquo;invisible&raquo; in&nbsp;the public one.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 1</h3>
        <p>
            Forget about&nbsp;WiFi passwords, you don&nbsp;t need them anymore. All you need to do is to generate 1&nbsp;times a password with a length of 63&nbsp;characters (this is the maximum value for a password in&nbsp;WPA), including ASCII special characters that are not present on the&nbsp;keyboard, and&nbsp;generate a QR code for your network. All modern smartphones can read&nbsp;QR codes, you will only need to take a picture of&nbsp;QR code or print it to &laquo;share&nbsp;it.
        </p>
        <h3>Rule 2</h3>
        <p>
            Use WiFi networks outside your home (outside your network)&nbsp;&mdash; only via VPN. Many modern routers are able to create a VPN server, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;s not&nbsp;difficult to do if&nbsp;you have a stationary computer at home, which is always switched on and&nbsp;always in&nbsp;the network. It&nbsp;can be a single-board computer like RaspberryPI, which&nbsp;costs inexpensive and&nbsp;takes up no&nbsp;space. You should make it a&nbsp;rule to use the Internet via WiFi only via VPN from&nbsp;your home. Any passerby and&nbsp;hotel guest will still be able to intercept your traffic, knowing the hotel password, but for them it will be encrypted VPN traffic, which will definitely be useless without access to&nbsp;your VPN.
