        <h1>Why it`s important?</h1>
        <p>
            Someone will say: &laquo;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;not&nbsp;greedy. If a neighbour's child is so advanced that he can launch such an attack&nbsp;&mdash; I&nbsp;ll&nbsp;be happy for&nbsp;him&raquo;. And&nbsp;what if I&nbsp;tell you that having a password from&nbsp;your network, a neighbour's child can not&nbsp;only communicate with&nbsp;terrorists from&nbsp;your network, for example, but&nbsp;also&nbsp;intercept all your traffic? In&nbsp;the https era, of course, this is not&nbsp;very relevant, but&nbsp;only on&nbsp;the&nbsp;side. For example, it&nbsp;won&nbsp;t&nbsp;be able to read your correspondence in&nbsp;mail or Facebook, however, it&nbsp;will&nbsp;be able to detect your porn sites, calculate with&nbsp;accuracy up to&nbsp;a byte how much traffic and&nbsp;time you&nbsp;spend on&nbsp;YouTube, will be able to see your VPN connections and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, you&nbsp;can set yourself a 12-character password (which is not&nbsp;quite right, more details in&nbsp;the next article) with&nbsp;a lot of special characters, which&nbsp;would take many thousands of years to&nbsp;find at current capacities. But&nbsp;you&nbsp;are&nbsp;completely calmly entering passwords from&nbsp;&laquo;public&raquo; networks. Say, for example, a hotel has a simple password 12345678, you&nbsp;enter it without a second thought and&nbsp;forget about&nbsp;the fact that any of the&nbsp;guests of this hotel, knowing the password, can intercept and&nbsp;decrypt your traffic. Again&nbsp;if you&nbsp;use https, a hacker will not&nbsp;be able to read your correspondence or find out what pornographic film you&nbsp;watched last night before going to bed, but&nbsp;he&nbsp;will&nbsp;know exactly what resources you&nbsp;ve visited and&nbsp;how much time/traffic you&nbsp;ve spent on&nbsp;them.
        </p>
        <p>
            You&nbsp;re&nbsp;unlikely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;thrilled&nbsp;that any&nbsp;essentially passerby will be able to know exactly what resources you&nbsp;re visiting + will be able to use your internet. If it's the neighbour's kid and&nbsp;he&nbsp;s just doing it for fun, that's nice. But&nbsp;what if your network is being used for illegal operations? What if there's a knock on YOUR door tomorrow asking why you&nbsp;ve been downloading child pornography?
        </p>

            Someone will say: &laquo;Yes&nbsp;Who needs me? Yes&nbsp;who will bother? &raquo;. Firstly, you need ) otherwise&nbsp;Facebook, Google and&nbsp;Apple would not&nbsp;collect&nbsp;all information about&nbsp;you by&nbsp;bits and pieces. Secondly, in&nbsp;2022, the most populous altcoin, Etherium, switched from&nbsp;proof-of-works to&nbsp;proof-of-stake. If you&nbsp;didn&nbsp;t&nbsp;understand a&nbsp;word in&nbsp;the&nbsp;last sentence, just imagine that &laquo;miners&raquo; used to earn money from&nbsp;video cards, and&nbsp;now they&nbsp;ve been completely deprived of that income. On&nbsp;the main page I&nbsp;m&nbsp;providing calculations for&nbsp;one nvidia 4090 graphics card, but&nbsp;now imagine that millions of the most powerful graphics cards around&nbsp;the world a year ago lost&laquo;earnings&raquo; and&nbsp;are hanging around doing nothing.
