# How much your WiFi?

A simple tool that clearly shows you how much it costs to hack your WiFi. 

## Funny project?

Yes and no.

On the one hand, it's fun to see how much money it takes to pick the password to your WiFi network. More often than not, the amount won't exceed $100. Doesn't seem like a small amount, does it? However, this is the amount of money that will allow any passerby not just to access your network, but to access all the sites you visit, all the applications you use. It doesn't seem like child's play anymore.

## How bad is it?

As usual, the most vulnerable part in any system is the human being. WiFi can be secure, but 90% of the time, WiFi is very vulnerable. It's not even about someone being able to access your network and, for example, communicate with terrorists on your behalf. It's that attackers will be able to access your traffic. Even though you most often use https and there is no way to decrypt your traffic, attackers will have access to at least the domains you visit. Simply put -- an attacker will not see the videos you watch on pornhub.com, but they will know exactly when, how much, and how often you do it.

Answer yourself this question, would you be willing to give this data to any passerby for $100?
